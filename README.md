# squire-boilerplate
This is my personal strarting point for one-webpages and simple websites.
The framework itself is pretty minimal. It provides custom routes and views, and supports multilanguage (with a subfolder url structure).

The repo uses webpack and npm scripts for bundling resources. Usage:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build` to compile everything or `npm run watch` to start a dev server
3. thatâ€™s it

The file `/public/data/config.json` contains environment-related vars, so be sure to ignore it when syncing with production environments.

Happy coding.
